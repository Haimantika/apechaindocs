## Hackathon Format

#### What can be submitted?

There are three categories of submissions, each with their own prize tracks.

<li>New Projects</li>
<li>Existing Projects</li>
<li>Open Source Contributions</li>

#### Can you elaborate on the categories of submissions?


New Projects: Projects are created on the start date of the hackathon, repositories will be checked, and the team will reach out if there are questions are your project

Exisiting Projects: Projects are projects which have already been deployed on X which now have expanded to ApeChain.


Open Source Contributions create something for the community, education material, addition to the docs, sample-project, etc. 


#### Anything that would give me an edge?

Reboot
Yuga ID 
(define what this looks like) (if building using this, where will they find information on this?) 


If you’re a net new project, we’d love to see the creative juices flow on projects across social-fi, gaming, or anything else that can add to the front-end experience of ApeChain for end users.
