## Etherscan

[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is working with ApeChain by supporting contract verification and blockchain exploration for our L3 network. Through the use of the ape-etherscan plugin, developers working on ApeChain can publish and verify their smart contracts using Etherscan's platform. This allows for a more transparent and reliable system where contracts on ApeChain can be verified.

This integration not only helps ensure contract authenticity, but also provides developers with the tools they need to interact with the ApeChain network efficiently. By setting up custom network configurations, ApeChain can leverage Etherscan’s powerful tools for tracking transactions, managing contracts, and ensuring that all activities on the chain are visible and verifiable​.
