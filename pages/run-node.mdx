## Using the Repo

The repo is setup to easily run curtis testnet replica nodes. Simply run `docker-compose up` in the root of the repository to bring a replica node up locally.

The docker image for curtis testnet is hosted in a public docker repo: `public.ecr.aws/i6b2w2n6/nitro-node:curtis3`

The nodeConfig file within is prepopulated with curtis testnet parameters. The current setup uses a public rpc url for the Arbitrum Sepolia rpc and stores node data in docker volume.

It is recommended to replace the Arbitrum Sepolia rpc url in `docker-compose.yml` with your own private url to avoid being rate limited. By default, this value is set to Arbitrum's public RPC url.
