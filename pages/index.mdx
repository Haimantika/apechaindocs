# ApeChain
ApeChain is a dedicated infrastructure layer to power the ApeCoin ecosystem.
By leveraging Caldera and Arbitrum's custom native token feature, ApeChain utilizes $APE as its native gas token. This integration significantly enhances $APE's utility, fostering a robust and dynamic economy driven by $APE, and positioning ApeChain as a premier platform.

Through Caldera and Arbitrum's custom native token feature, ApeChain will utilize $APE as its native gas token, providing significant utility to the token while enabling a rich native economy powered by $APE.

### ApeChain at its core is an Arbitrum Orbit L3.

Orbit chains are deployable, configurable instances of the Arbitrum Nitro tech stack that can be tailored precisely to match a project's exact use-case and business needs.
Each Orbit chain is capable of supporting many times the capacity of Ethereum, all while benefitting directly from Ethereum's security.

Orbit Chains can be a Layer 2 (L2) chain which settles directly to Ethereum, or a Layer 3 (L3) chain - like **ApeChain** - which can settle to any Ethereum L2, such as Arbitrum One.
