# Block Explorers

### Blockscout

[Blockscout](https://curtis.explorer.caldera.xyz/) is a widely-used, open-source blockchain explorer developed by the POA Network. It allows users to explore and interact with EVM compatible blockchains. Blockscout is completely open-source, which means developers can modify, deploy, and integrate it with various blockchain networks to suit their needs.

Blockscout provides a range of features, such as transaction verification, smart contract interaction, and comprehensive data analytics. It also offers tools for developers, including APIs for seamless integration and support for dApps. This makes it a valuable tool for both users and developers looking to engage with blockchain data in a transparent and decentralized manner.

In its collaboration with ApeChain, Blockscout serves as the primary blockchain explorer, allowing users and developers within the ApeCoin ecosystem to explore transactions, interact with smart contracts, and monitor on-chain activities. By leveraging Blockscoutâ€™s open-source framework, ApeChain ensures that its community has access to a transparent and efficient tool for blockchain exploration and analysis, enhancing the overall user experience on the platform.
